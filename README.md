KMeans Clustering🧠📊
This project demonstrates how to perform K-Means Clustering using Python on the popular Iris dataset. It includes data preprocessing, applying the KMeans algorithm, evaluating the model using the elbow method, and visualizing the clusters.

📁 Files in this Project
Kmeans.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and explanations.

(optional) requirements.txt: A file you can add to list the required packages for easy setup.

📊 Dataset Used
The project uses the Iris dataset, which contains 150 flower samples with 4 features each:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

The dataset includes 3 species of flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
